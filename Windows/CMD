# What's a batch file?

The definition of a batch file as it used in a Windows/DOS environment is a text file that
contains a series of commands that executed in sequence for Windows for perform and
operation.

## Why is it called a batch file?

It's called a batch file because it "batches" a sequence of commands that would normally
have to be ran one at times.

## How do you execute a batch file?

You can run a batch file two ways. Create a shortcut the batch file or create your own
batch file and save it to your desktop or somewhere in the files structure you have
access. Then you can either double click the icon for the batch file, or you can execute
from the command line simply by typing the filename and extension, e.g. batchfile.bat,
and pressing enter.

## Batch File: Commands

The purpose of batch files is run many DOS commands at once sometimes
pausing to allow the administrator to interact with the operation by entering
data or starting the process if the process is paused. The commands that are
used to "program" the batch file are similar to DOS commands. Here is a list of
the important commands that are used and their definitions:

. ECHO - Displays text on the screen.
. ECHO OFF - Hides the text that is normally output.
. START - Run a file with its default application.
. REM - Inserts a comment line in the program.
. MKDIR/RMDIR - Create and remove directories.
· DEL - Deletes a file or files.
. COPY - Copy a file or files.
. COPY - Allows you to copy files with extra options.
· FOR/IN/DO - This command lets you specify files.
