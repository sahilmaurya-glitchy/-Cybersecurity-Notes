### 1. LAN (Local Area Network)

- Definition: A LAN connects computers and devices within a small geographic area, such as a single building, school, or office.
- Range: Typically up to a few kilometers (usually within a building or campus).
- Components: Routers, switches, computers, printers.
- Advantages: High data transfer rates, low latency, cost-effective for small areas.
- Example: The network inside a small office, where all computers and printers are connected.
- Uses:
    - File sharing
    - Printer sharing
    - Centralized data storage

### 2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

- Definition: A MAN covers a larger geographic area than a LAN, typically a city or large campus.
- Range: Typically spans several kilometers, covering a city or town.
- Components: Routers, switches, optical fiber, modems.
- Advantages: Connects multiple LANs within a city, offers higher data transfer rates than WAN.
- Example: The network connecting all branches of a company within a city.
- Uses:
    - Interconnecting multiple buildings or campuses within a city

### 3. WAN (Wide Area Network)

- Definition: A WAN covers a broad geographic area, often connecting multiple cities, countries, or even continents.
- Range: Can span thousands of kilometers, from country-wide to worldwide.
- Components: Routers, leased lines, satellites, public internet.
- Advantages: Enables long-distance communication, supports a large number of users.
- Example: The internet itself, or a multinational company's network connecting offices worldwide.

### 4. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)

- Definition: A WLAN is a type of LAN that uses wireless communication (Wi-Fi) to connect devices within a local area.
- Range: Similar to LAN, typically within a building or limited outdoor space (up to a few hundred meters).
- Components: Wireless routers, access points, wireless network adapters.
- Advantages: Provides mobility and flexibility, no need for physical cables.
- Example: The Wi-Fi network in a home, coffee shop, or university campus.
- Uses:
    - Wireless internet access
    - Connecting laptops, smartphones, and tablets
    - Enabling smart home devices
