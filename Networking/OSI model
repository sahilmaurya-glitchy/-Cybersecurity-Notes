# OSI model [Open system inter-connection]

- Software Layers
    - Application Layer
        1. Provide user-interface
        2. Provide Different Protocols like https, SMTP, FTP, etc
    - Presentation Layer
        1. Data reformatting
        2. Data encryption
        3. Data Compress
    - Session Layer
        1. Establish session between to computers and maintain session till user logout
        2. Add checkpoints in data transfer
        3. Terminate session
- Transport Layer
    
    Also known as “Heart of OSI model”. It helps in make connection between Software Layers and Hardware Layers.
    
    1. Divides data into segments
    2. Provide reliable data transfer through error detection and correction
    3. Manage flow control to prevent network congestion
- Hardware Layers
    - Network Layer
        1. Convert data segments into packets
        2. Uses IP [Internet protocol] address to send data
        3. Selects shortest path between source and destination with help of router
    - Data Link Layer
        1. Divides data packets into frames
        2. Switch, Hub, network card are worked in this layer
        3. Mac [Media access control] address used in transfer data from one system to another
        4. Data hopping happens here, likely refers to the movement or transfer of data between different points or systems in a network or process.
        5. Sends acknowledgment signal after receiving frames
        6. Re-transfer frames if it get lost
    - Physical Layer
        1. The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI model, responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium, such as cables or wireless signals.
        2. Decides 1 bit lifetime
        3. Data rate
        4. Modes of communication

### TCP [Transmission control protocol]

 Connection oriented : In connection oriented model first connection is established then communication starts.

### UDP [User Datagram protocol]

Connection Less : In connection less model connection is not established just messages are sent
