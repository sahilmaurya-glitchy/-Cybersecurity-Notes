### 1. What is NTP?

- NTP: Stands for Network Time Protocol.
- Purpose: Used to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network to a precise time reference.
- Importance: Ensures all devices on a network have the same time, which is crucial for time-sensitive applications like logging events, security, and transaction timestamps.

### 2. How NTP Works

- Hierarchy of Clocks:
    - Stratum Levels: NTP uses a hierarchical system called stratum levels.
        - Stratum 0: High-precision time sources (e.g., atomic clocks, GPS clocks).
        - Stratum 1: Servers directly connected to Stratum 0 devices (primary time servers).
        - Stratum 2: Servers synchronized with Stratum 1 servers (secondary time servers).
    - Lower Stratum Number = Higher Accuracy of the time source.
- Synchronization Process:
    - NTP client requests time from NTP server.
    - Server responds with its current time.
    - Client adjusts its clock to match the server’s time, accounting for any delays.

### 3. NTP Communication

- Port: NTP uses UDP port 123 for communication.
- Protocol: Works over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is faster and lighter than TCP.

### 4. NTP Modes of Operation

- Client-Server Mode: The most common mode where the client synchronizes its time with an NTP server.
- Symmetric Mode: Used for synchronization between two NTP servers, each acting as both client and server.
- Broadcast/Multicast Mode: A server broadcasts time to multiple clients without them needing to request it.
- Peer Mode: NTP servers act as peers, sharing time information among themselves.

### 5. Example of NTP Use

- Scenario: A company’s network with multiple servers and devices.
    - NTP Server: Synchronizes with an external Stratum 1 server (e.g., connected to GPS).
    - Internal Devices: All computers, routers, and switches synchronize their clocks with the company’s NTP server, ensuring accurate and consistent time across the network.

### 6. Key Terms

- Jitter: Variations in time delay when data is being sent or received. NTP tries to minimize jitter.
- Offset: The difference in time between the NTP client’s clock and the server’s clock.
- Drift: The natural tendency of a clock to lose or gain time, which NTP corrects over time.

### 7. Uses of NTP

- Security: Accurate timestamps for logs to track events and detect anomalies.
- Data Integrity: Ensures consistency in transactions across distributed systems.
- Compliance: Some regulations require synchronized time for accurate auditing and reporting.
