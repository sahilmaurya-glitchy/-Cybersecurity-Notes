# Ports

Computer Ports: Physical or virtual docking points through which data is sent or received between computers and other devices.

### Types of Ports:

- Physical Ports: Hardware interfaces on devices (e.g., USB, HDMI).
- Virtual Ports: Software-based endpoints in network communication (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

### Physical Ports:

- USB (Universal Serial Bus):
    - Used to connect peripherals like keyboards, mice, printers, etc.
    - Examples: USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB-C.
- HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface):
    - Transmits audio and video from computers to monitors, TVs.
    - Example: HDMI 1.4, HDMI 2.0.
- Ethernet Port (RJ-45):
    - Used for wired network connections.
    - Common speeds: 10/100/1000 Mbps (Megabits per second).
- Audio Ports (3.5mm Jack):
    - Used for headphones, microphones, and speakers.
    - Types: Line-in, Line-out, Mic-in.
- VGA (Video Graphics Array):
    - Analog connection for monitors.
    - Replaced by HDMI and DisplayPort.
- DisplayPort:
    - Digital display interface, supports higher resolutions than HDMI.

### Virtual Ports:

- Port Numbers:
    - Used in networking to distinguish between different services on a computer.
    - Example: HTTP (Port 80), HTTPS (Port 443), FTP (Port 21), SSH (Port 22).
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Ports:
    - Reliable, connection-oriented protocol.
    - Used for web browsing, email (e.g., SMTP, IMAP).
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) Ports:
    - Connectionless, faster but less reliable.
    - Used for streaming, online gaming (e.g., DNS, VoIP).

### Common Port Numbers:

- Port 21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Transfers files between client and server.
- Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell) – Securely access remote devices.
- Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – Sends emails.
- Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System) – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) – Unsecured web browsing.
- Port 443: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) – Secured web browsing.
- Port 110: POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) – Retrieves emails from server.
- Port 143: IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) – Manages emails directly on the server.
- Port 3389: RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – Remotely controls another computer.

### Uses of Ports:

- Data Transmission: Ports enable the transfer of data between devices and over the internet.
- Security: Ports can be opened or closed by firewalls to protect systems from unauthorized access.
- Networking: Facilitate communication between different networked devices.

### Security Considerations:

- Open Ports: Vulnerable to attacks if not properly managed.
- Firewalls: Used to block unnecessary ports and secure the network.
