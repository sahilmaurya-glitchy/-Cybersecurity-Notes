# VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

- Definition:
    
    A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) allows you to create multiple, isolated logical networks on a single physical network infrastructure.
    
- Purpose:
    
    It is used to segment a large network into smaller, manageable parts, improving performance, security, and traffic management.
    
- Key Features:
    - Logical Separation: Devices on different VLANs cannot communicate directly without a router.
    - Reduced Broadcast Traffic: Reduces unnecessary broadcast traffic across the entire network.
    - Improved Security: Helps isolate sensitive data by grouping devices into separate VLANs.
    - Scalability: Easily add or modify devices in the network without affecting the entire physical network.
- Common Uses:
    - Department Segmentation: E.g., separating HR, Finance, and IT departments within a company.
    - Guest Networks: Creating isolated guest VLANs for visitors in an organization.
    - VoIP Traffic Management: Isolating voice traffic from data traffic for better quality.
- Types of VLANs:
    - Data VLAN: Used for user-generated traffic (like browsing, emails, etc.).
    - Voice VLAN: Optimized for carrying VoIP (Voice over IP) traffic.
    - Management VLAN: Used to manage network devices (e.g., switches, routers).
    - Native VLAN: The default VLAN for untagged traffic on a switch port.
- Example:
    - Scenario: An office has two departments: Sales and IT. By placing Sales devices in VLAN 10 and IT devices in VLAN 20, communication between the two is restricted unless routed, improving security and traffic management.

# DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

- Definition:
    
    A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a separate network used to isolate publicly accessible services (e.g., websites, email servers) from the internal, private network.
    
- Purpose:
    
    It adds a layer of security by separating external-facing services from the internal network, reducing the risk of external attacks.
    
- Key Features:
    - Public Access: Services in the DMZ (e.g., web servers) are accessible from the internet, but isolated from the internal network.
    - Increased Security: If an attacker compromises a server in the DMZ, they are less likely to reach the internal network.
    - Traffic Control: DMZ servers can interact with both the internet and the internal network, but strict firewall rules regulate this traffic.
- Common Uses:
    - Web Servers: Hosting a company website in the DMZ so external users can access it without exposing internal systems.
    - Email Servers: Placing email servers in the DMZ to handle internet-facing email communication securely.
    - FTP Servers: Hosting an FTP server in the DMZ to allow file transfers without exposing internal systems.
- Example:
    - Scenario: A company hosts its public website on a web server in the DMZ. External users can access the website, but even if the server is compromised, the internal company network remains protected.
