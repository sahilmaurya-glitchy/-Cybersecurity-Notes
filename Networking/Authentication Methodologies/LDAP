LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

---

- Definition:
    
    LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, which is used for accessing and managing directory services over a network. It helps in retrieving and modifying information from a directory service like user details, devices, and other resources.
    
- Purpose:
    
    LDAP is widely used for authentication and authorization in organizations to manage access to applications and systems.

 Key Components of LDAP

1. Directory:
    - A database optimized for read-heavy operations.
    - Stores hierarchical information like users, groups, devices, and other network objects.
    - Example: An employee directory containing names, email addresses, and job titles.
2. Entry:
    - A basic unit in an LDAP directory.
    - Every entry has a Distinguished Name (DN), which is unique.
    - Example: `uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`
3. Attributes:
    - Properties of each entry.
    - Example: For a user, attributes could be name, email, phone number.
    - Format: `attributeName: attributeValue`
    - Example: `mail: john.doe@example.com`
4. Distinguished Name (DN):
    - A unique identifier for an entry in the directory.
    - Composed of a sequence of attributes that specify the exact location of the entry.
    - Example: `cn=John Doe,ou=Employees,dc=example,dc=com`
5. Object Classes:
    - Define the types of entries (e.g., user, group).
    - Each entry must belong to an object class that defines the mandatory and optional attributes.

 LDAP Operations

1. Bind:
    - Used to authenticate a client to the LDAP server.
    - Example: A user logs in with a username and password.
2. Search:
    - Retrieves entries based on filters.
    - Example: Searching for all users with the last name "Doe."
3. Compare:
    - Compares an entry’s attribute to a given value.
    - Example: Checking if the email of a user is `john.doe@example.com`.
4. Add:
    - Adds a new entry to the directory.
    - Example: Creating a new user account in the directory.
5. Delete:
    - Removes an entry from the directory.
6. Modify:
    - Updates the attributes of an existing entry.
    - Example: Updating the email address of a user.

 LDAP Structure (DIT)

- DIT (Directory Information Tree):The hierarchical structure of an LDAP directory.
    - Root (top level): Domain (e.g., `dc=com`)
    - Branches: Organizational Units (OU) (e.g., `ou=People`)
    - Leaves: Specific entries like users or devices.

 LDAP Authentication

- LDAP is commonly used for authenticating users in applications, especially for Single Sign-On (SSO) systems.
- LDAP servers can store credentials and verify user identities.

---

 LDAP in Use

- Example: In a company, LDAP can manage user login details, granting access to internal applications like email and file-sharing platforms.
- LDAP with Active Directory:Microsoft’s Active Directory is a popular directory service that uses LDAP for querying and managing network resources like computers, users, and groups.

 LDAP Ports

- Port 389: Default port for unencrypted LDAP communication.
- Port 636: Used for LDAP over SSL (LDAPS), which is a secure version of LDAP.

 Advantages of LDAP

1. Scalability:
    - Suitable for both small and large directories.
2. Cross-platform compatibility:
    - LDAP works on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
3. Centralized management:
    - Central point for managing user credentials and permissions.

 Example Use Case

- Scenario: A university using LDAP to manage student accounts.
    - Students can use the same username and password to access different services like email, library resources, and the learning management system.
