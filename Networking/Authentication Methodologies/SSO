 SSO (Single Sign-On) â€“ Key Points for Revision

---

 1. Definition of SSO:

- SSO (Single Sign-On): A user authentication process that allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without needing to log in again for each.

---

 2. How SSO Works:

- Central Authentication Server: The SSO system has a central server that handles user authentication.
- Session Token: After the user logs in, the SSO server creates a session token that is used to verify the user across different systems.
- Trust Relationships: Applications connected to the SSO system trust the session token, so no additional login is needed.

---

 3. Key Components of SSO:

- Identity Provider (IdP): Verifies user identity (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
- Service Providers (SP): The applications or services that the user wants to access (e.g., Gmail, Slack).
- Authentication Protocols: Protocols used by SSO to pass authentication info (e.g., SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OAuth (Open Authorization), OpenID Connect).

---

 4. Benefits of SSO:

- Convenience: Users only need to remember one set of credentials.
- Improved Security: Reduced password fatigue, leading to fewer weak passwords.
- Time-Saving: Faster access to multiple services without logging in repeatedly.

---

 5. Common SSO Use Cases:

- Enterprise SSO: Employees access email, cloud services, and internal apps with one login.
- Consumer SSO: Users log in to multiple apps using social media accounts (e.g., logging into Spotify with a Google account).

---

 6. Examples of SSO:

- Google SSO: Logging into YouTube, Google Drive, and Gmail with one Google account.
- Facebook SSO: Logging into third-party apps (e.g., Instagram, Spotify) using your Facebook credentials.

---

 7. Security Concerns in SSO:

- Single Point of Failure: If the SSO account is compromised, all linked services are at risk.
- Mitigation: Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to strengthen security.

---

 8. Popular SSO Solutions:

- Okta: Cloud-based SSO solution.
- Microsoft Azure AD: Used in enterprises to provide SSO to Microsoft services and other apps.

---

 9. Protocols Used in SSO:

- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): Used for exchanging authentication data between IdP and SP.
- OAuth: Authorization protocol allowing access to resources without sharing credentials.
- OpenID Connect: Identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 for verifying user identity.

---

 10. SSO in Action:

- Example: If you log in to Google, you can use Gmail, YouTube, and Google Drive without needing to log in separately.
